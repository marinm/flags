Shareable match link
https://marinm.net/flags?m=3241311917


When the match is done, what does the URL return?

or... a UUID-type URL that persists in the server
all games are saved?
so the player can return to it?

How do these URL's look?

This doesn't make much sense - the match should not be in the public URL namespace
